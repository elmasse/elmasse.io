One of the benefits of creating your own tailwindcss plugin is that you can add your own css to any of the different layers (base, components, utilities).

In this case, I wanted to provide a plugin for my fonts of choice. The key for that plugin was to add the imports or font-face definitions right into the base layer.

There are basically two ways of doing it. The tedious one, copying the font-face definitions and modify it to apply it as a json config. Something like:

```js

const plugin = require('tailwindcss/plugin')

module.exports = plugin(function ({ addBase }) {
 addBase({
   '@font-face': [{
       fontFamily: 'Bitter',
       fontStyle: 'italic',
       fontWeight: 400,
       fontDisplay: 'swap',
       src: `url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/bitter/v17/raxjHiqOu8IVPmn7epZnDMyKBvHf5D6c4Pz-UnB0n-ChBltdqi4.woff) format('woff')`,
      unicodeRange: 'U+0460-052F, U+1C80-1C88, U+20B4, U+2DE0-2DFF, U+A640-A69F, U+FE2E-FE2F',
    },
   // ... keep going ...
   }]
 })
})
```

But this is not good. There should be another way.

Good news, there is another way. Yeah, I spoiled that already.

I did a few more research (in fact it took me a whole morning to figure it out). You can use the `@import` directive making it easier to maintain, update, etc:

```js

const plugin = require('tailwindcss/plugin')

module.exports = plugin(function ({ addBase }) {
 addBase({
   [`@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Bitter:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,600;0,700;1,400&display=swap')`]: true
  })
})
```

As ugly as it looks it works pretty well. The trick here is to define the import statement as a key of the object configuration and set it to `true`. In this way we can copy and paste the import statement generated by Google Fonts (or any other fonts CDN)
