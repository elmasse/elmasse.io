This is a very personal post. Last year (2021) was an inflection point. I decided to leave the company I founded with some friends (GEUT) and take a different path. 

In the middle there was tons of bad and some not so good days. Personally, it was an exploration period that left me in a couple of very bad moments. I acted like an idiot, I mistreated friends and colleagues and all that lead to understand that the main issue was internal. 

It is not easy to deal with people. And it is even harder to deal with people like myself.

So after a few months, a some kind of intervention, and many back and forth on ideas and direction, I decided (and I have been invited to) leave the company. 

## New Ideas

A few weeks later I have the urgency of start doing something. I started to rework one of my personal projects. But something was missing. I needed to work with someone that can keep the motivation. 

That person emerged after some talks and many coffees. And with him a few ideas for a problem that he noticed at his own company. 

So the next couple months will be pretty interesting. I’m not sure how far we will get on this new adventure but I’m pretty sure it will be a tremendous opportunity to learn and to create something that can help people or at least improve someone’s life. 

Stay tuned. I want to get the habit of start writing more this year. And this new endeavor seems to be a great topic.
